  <p> The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core.<br> The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>
  <h1>Mercury</h1>

  <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.<br> Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.  </p>
  <h1>Venus</h1>

  <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition.<br> As an interior planet to Earth, Venus appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. </p>

  <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place in the universe known to harbor life.<br> While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.<br> Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.</p>
  <h1>Mars</h1>

  <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.<br> It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,<br> while being slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.</p>
